21sh may be compiled for various purposes, each option including or restricting the compilation of individual files in various ways. To compile the project with no added libraries, `$> make`. To compile the project with debug options (e.g., `gcc -g -fsanitize=address ...`), compile with `make TEST={1|FULL} `, where `TEST=FULL` will compile all project files with the debug options, and `TEST=1` includes debug options only with files inside the `src` directory. Similarly, `bmake LEAKS={1|FULL}` will compile the bproject with files needed for debugging.
