21sh may be compiled for various purposes, each option including or restricting the compilation of individual files in various ways. To compile the project with no added libraries, `$> make`. To compile the project with debug options (e.g., `gcc -g -fsanitize=address ...`), compile with `make TEST={1|FULL} `, where `TEST=FULL` will compile all project files with the debug options, and `TEST=1` includes debug options only with files inside the `src` directory. Similarly, `bmake LEAKS={1|FULL}` will compile the bproject with files needed for debugging.

When executing 21sh for development purposes, two environment variables will affect the execution of the shell. When the env variable `SHELL_TTY={ttyid}` is present, 21sh will open the ttyid id given and use it as the basis for `STDIN|STDOUT|STDERR` of the shell. When  `SHELL_LEAKS` is present and set to a value, the shell will exit after a given command and hang indefinetely, until `x` followed by `<return>` is entered into the STDIN.
